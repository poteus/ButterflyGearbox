FRC 6651 - Summer 2018 - Butterfly Gearbox

This summer, Golden Bots decided to create a Butterfly Gearbox for the drivetrain for next season.

This project will control the wheels status (omni or traction) with a piston.
The wheels will be controlled using the normal arcade system (2 motors on each side).

In the future, we will look for the possibility to get the 4 motors controlled independently.
